# BEwT-E
BEwT-E [1] is an extension of the Basic Elements [2].
These metrics compare a summary and reference based on matches between heads of syntactic phrases and dependency tree-based relations.
Our implementation wraps a [mavenized fork](https://github.com/igorbrigadir/ROUGE-BEwTE) of the original code.

## Setting Up
Running BEwT-E requires having Git LFS, Java 1.6, and Maven installed.
Then, it can be set up with the following command:
```bash
sacrerouge setup-metric bewte
```

To verify your installation, run:
```bash
pytest sacrerouge/tests/metrics/bewte_test.py
```
