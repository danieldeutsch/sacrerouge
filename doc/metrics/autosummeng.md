# AutoSummENG, MeMoG, and NPowER
AutoSummENG [1, 2], MeMoG [1], and NPoWER [3] are a family of reference-based evaluation metrics that use n-gram graphs to compare the content of a summary and set of reference summaries.

## Setting Up
Running the AutoSummENG code requires Java 1.8 and Maven to be installed.
To set up the dependencies, run:
```bash
sacrerouge setup-metric autosummeng
```
