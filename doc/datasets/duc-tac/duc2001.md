# DUC 2001
[Homepage](https://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/2001.html)

For DUC 2001, we provide dataset readers for task 1 (single-document summarization) and task 2 (multi-document summarization).
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset duc2001 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.train.jsonl`: The training data for task 1
- `task1.test.jsonl`: The test data for task 1
- `task2.train.X.jsonl`: The training data for task 2 with target summaries of length `X` for `X` in `[50, 100, 200, 400]`
- `task2.test.X.jsonl`: The same as the above but for testing

## Notes
The input documents for DUC 2001 did not always have a standard schema, so parsing them was quite difficult.
Therefore, there may be noise in the documents.
