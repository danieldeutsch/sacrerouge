# TAC 2011
[Homepage](https://tac.nist.gov/2011/Summarization/)

For TAC 2011, we provide dataset readers for tasks 1 and the submitted AESOP values.
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset tac2011 \
    <path-to-gigaword-root> \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-gigaword-root>` is the path to the root of `LDC2011T07/gigaword_eng_5`.
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.X.jsonl`: The data for task 1 for document sets `X`. The file includes just set A (`A`), B (`B`), or both (`A-B`).
- `task1.X.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.X.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.X.pyramids.jsonl`: The Pyramids for the set of references for task 1
- `task1.X.pyramid-annotations.jsonl`: The Pyramid annotations for each submitted peer and reference summary for task 1

## Notes
It appears that the Pyramid annotations were exhasutive (identifying SCUs which are not present in the reference Pyramids).
Those extra SCUs are not loaded here.

There are Pyramids for the combined A-B summaries, which we do not load.

The Pyramid annotations have incorrect SCU IDs, so they should be used with caution.
Here is an example:
