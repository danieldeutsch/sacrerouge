# TAC 2008
[Homepage](https://tac.nist.gov/2008/summarization/)

For TAC 2008, we provide dataset readers for tasks 1.
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset tac2008 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.X.jsonl`: The data for task 1 for document sets `X`. The file includes just set A (`A`), B (`B`), or both (`A-B`).
- `task1.X.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.X.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.X.pyramids.jsonl`: The Pyramids for the set of references for task 1
- `task1.X.pyramid-annotations.jsonl`: The Pyramid annotations for each submitted peer and reference summary for task 1
