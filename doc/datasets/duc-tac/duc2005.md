# DUC 2005
[Homepage](https://duc.nist.gov/duc2005/)

For DUC 2005, we provide dataset readers for the single task.
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset duc2005 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.jsonl`: The data for the task
- `task1.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for the task
- `task1.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for the task

## Notes
The reference summaries in `ROUGE/extras` are not loaded in `summaries` because they weren't used in evaluation even though they do have some judgments (for example, linguistic quality).

Some of the pyramid scores were done twice. We only take the last score.
