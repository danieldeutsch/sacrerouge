# DUC 2007
[Homepage](https://duc.nist.gov/duc2007/tasks.html)

For DUC 2007, we provide dataset readers for both tasks 1 and 2.
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset duc2007 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.jsonl`: The data for task 1
- `task1.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.pyramids.jsonl`: The Pyramids for the set of references for task 1
- `task1.pyramid-annotations.jsonl`: The Pyramid annotations for each submitted peer and reference summary for task 1
- `task2.X.jsonl`: The data for task 2 for document sets `X`. The file includes just set A (`A`), B (`B`), C (`C`), or all three (`A-B-C`).
- `task2.X.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 2
- `task2.X.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 2
- `task2.X.pyramids.jsonl`: The Pyramids for the set of references for task 2
