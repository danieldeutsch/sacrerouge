# DUC 2002
[Homepage](https://www-nlpir.nist.gov/projects/duc/guidelines/2002.html)

For DUC 2002, we provide dataset readers for task 1 (single-document summarization) and task 2 (multi-document summarization).
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset duc2002 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `task1.jsonl`: The data for task 1
- `task1.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task1.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 1
- `task2.X.jsonl`: The data for task 2 for the summary target length `X`
- `task2.X.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task 2 length `X`
- `task2.X.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task 2 length `X`
- `task2.Xe.jsonl`: The extractive summarization data for task 2 length `X`

## Notes
Some of the human judgments were not all loaded (the `multijudge.short.results.table` results).
