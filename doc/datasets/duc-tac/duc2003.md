# DUC 2003
[Homepage](https://duc.nist.gov/duc2003/tasks.html)

For DUC 2003, we provide dataset readers for all 4 tasks.
```bash
sacrerouge setup-dataset duc2003 \
    <path-to-raw-data> \
    <output-dir>
```
The `<path-to-raw-data>` is the path to the root of the [DUC/TAC data repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) with the data already downloaded.

The output files are the following:
- `taskX.jsonl`: The data for task `X`
- `taskX.summaries.jsonl`: The submitted peer and reference summaries for task `X`
- `taskX.metrics.jsonl`: The corresponding automatic and manual evaluation metrics for the peer and reference summaries for task `X`
