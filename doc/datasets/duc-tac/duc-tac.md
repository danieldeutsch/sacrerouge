# DUC/TAC
The DUC (Document Understanding Conference) and TAC (Text Analysis Conference) provided many single- and multi-document summarization datasets with human judgments from 2001 to 2011.
Due to license restrictions, we cannot release any of this data.
However, if you have the usernames and passwords required to download the data, we have provided [this repository](https://github.com/danieldeutsch/duc-tac-data) which you can use to setup the data in the format required by SacreROUGE.
