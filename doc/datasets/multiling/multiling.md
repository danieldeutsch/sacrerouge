# MultiLing
The MultiLing workshop provides single- and multi-document summarization data in many languages besides English.
The homepage can be found [here](http://multiling.iit.demokritos.gr/).

Some of the MultiLing data is password protected, so we are unable to automatically set everything up.
However, if you have the data zip files, they can be passed as arguments to the setup commands.

For details related to each year, please see the corresponding documentation:
